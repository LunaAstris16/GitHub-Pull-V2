# GitHub-Pull-V2

So this is a V2 to my git hub pull "bot"
The way that this is different from the original is:
-It allows for multiple different applications to be run
-It has a terminal output that makes sense and is easy to use

Objective
A program that will run any apllication that I need for me and that when ever I accept a pr or push my own code to that branch then it
will Automatically pull the latest version from github and then restart that file for me
